# Community Mental Health Hub

## Mission
This project aims to create a centralized, openly accessible, and community-vetted repository of mental health resources. We serve as a reliable starting point for individuals seeking information, support, and professional help, while fostering a collaborative environment that reduces stigma through open contribution and discussion.

## Code of Conduct
We are committed to maintaining a respectful, stigma-free environment. All contributions and discussions must adhere to the following principles:
- Use respectful, non-judgmental language.
- Avoid stigmatizing language about mental health conditions.
- Respect the privacy and dignity of individuals.
- Be inclusive and welcoming to people of all backgrounds, identities, and experiences.
- Harassment, hate speech, or discriminatory behavior will not be tolerated.

Violations of this code of conduct may result in removal of content, blocking of contributors, or other appropriate actions.

## How to Contribute
We welcome contributions from everyone! To suggest a new resource or report an outdated/inaccurate resource, please follow these steps:

   - **Report an Outdated or Inaccurate Resource**: Use the "Report an Outdated or Inaccurate Resource" issue template.

2. **Fork the repository** to your own GitHub account.

3. **Create a new branch** from `main` (e.g., `add-crisis-text-line`).

5. **Commit your changes** and open a Pull Request (PR) back to the original repository's `main` branch.

6. In your PR description, **link to the issue** you are addressing (e.g., "Closes #12").
